# GameStore ASP.NET Project

## Description
This is an ASP.NET Core project using SQLite and various NuGet packages, written in C#.  
It allows full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on games.  
Each game has its own unique ID, name, genre ID (linked to genre), price, and release date stored in the database.  

This project was built following Julio Casal's **ASP.NET Core Full Course For Beginners** (Feb 22nd, 2024).
